                    <h2>Our Solution</h2>

                    <p>
                        In order to reach our set goal, we must emphasize on reducing the carbon emission. Plastic and fossil fuel are the main contenders to the global issue. Therefore, we have decided to create our app Climate+ that will increase people's motivation to reuse and recycle plastic, in addition to limiting private transportation and promote public commutations.
                        We recognize that it is not possible to solve the climate problem on our own.  We hope that we can overcome this grand challenge if we cooperate. We must expand the awareness, so that everyone can contribute,
                        instead of a few doing a lot. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Climate+ will increase awareness on this issue with challenges and competitions between
                        friends through official events and individual performances. Activities on Climate+ will reward points that can be spent on products in our benefit page provided by our sponsors. Let us explain how we have realized this!
                    </p>

                </div>

                    <h2>Why Climate+ ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Norway, 87% of all bottles are recycled for reuse. For each recycled bottle we save the amount of energy needed to re-charge your phone 70 times! Along with this, the act of recycling 36 kg of bottles for reuse lets out 1.4 kg of CO2 but saves 140 kg of CO2 by not burning them <a href="https://infinitum.no/aktuelt/pantesatser" target="_blank">(Infinitum, n.d.)</a>. In Oslo, the total amount of CO2-emissions in 2009 went down from 1.3 million to only 1 million tons in 2017. This is equivalent to a reduction of aproximately 22%, or 300 000 tons of CO2 a year. A significant reason for this is the availability of public transportation around the entire city, which lowers the use of private cars. <a href="https://www.klimaoslo.no/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2019/03/Klimagasstatistikk_Oslo_2017.pdf" target="_blank">(Klimaetaten, 2019)</a> By introducing rewarding incentives for e.g. recycling and use of public transportation, we hope to see these emission-rates lowered continually.

                    <h2>Earning Points</h2>

                    <p>
                        There are multiple ways to earn points. The method that accumulate the most points are the officially
                        hosted events. These events can be anything imaginable as long as it contributes to a better environment e.g. planting trees or cleaning a riverside full of plastic to meeting up at protests.
                        The amount of points each event rewards are decided by the time commitment and difficulty of the tasks set by the host. However,
                        there are also other ways to obtain points individually. This method requires you to connect Climate+ to
                        various environmental friendly apps and reap additional points when using their services e.g. commuting with public transportation instead of private, in addition to scanning the
                        receipt from recycling bottles.</p>

                    <h2>Leaderboard</h2>

                    <p>
                        Now to the fun part; the competition between you and your friends. Once you receive points, they will
                        count towards your ladder ranking. There will be official national and global ladders, but we highly
                        recommend that you also create your own ladder with a group of friends. This way you can keep track of your friends' current rating and try to stay ahead. While there are no rewards for winning a private ladder, we
                        imagine competetive people that wants some extra excitement could implement their own rewards privately.<br>
                        Ladders are divided into seasons to provide people who falls behind a new chance to get to the top. After a new season has
                        begun everybody start from scratch, with a rating of zero. However, your accumulated points so far will not be reset. You rating is purely based on how much
                        points you have been able to acquire during the specific season.
